# RecipeForSuccess
## Project Description
Recipe for Success is an all-use kitchen app for both new and experienced chefs. The app has a large database of recipes searchable by time, difficulty, cuisine, and more. Users can track their skills in different culinary techniques and level up as they complete recipes involving those skills.

Within recipes, keywords are linked to a definition or video so users can quickly understand unfamiliar terms. The experience will be both accepting to new chefs without being tedious or patronizing for more experienced chefs.
